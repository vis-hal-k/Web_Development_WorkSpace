The boiler plate 

It tells the version of HTML the file was written in.
For Latest version( HTML 5 ) →     <!DOCTYPE html>

The `doctype` declaration at the beginning of an HTML file is used to help computers understand the type of file and open the website quickly. It is not an HTML tag, but it is important to include it at the very beginning of your HTML documents.

The `doctype` declaration tells the web browser what version of HTML the page is written in. This is important because different versions of HTML have different rules and syntax.

For example, HTML 4.01 has different rules for framesets than HTML5. By including the correct `doctype` declaration, you ensure that the web browser knows which rules to follow when rendering your web page.

The `doctype` declaration for HTML5 is:

This declaration should be placed at the very beginning of your HTML document, before the `<html>` tag.

### <html lang=”en”>  </html>

The `lang` attribute is used to declare the language of the web page. To include the `lang` attribute, add it to the `html` tag like this: `<html lang="en">`. The `en` stands for English, but you can replace it with the appropriate language code for your web page. After the language code, you can add a country code if necessary.

The every   thing in introduce between this.

**So  it helps to open  website Fastly because its  not  take time to understand which type of file.**

# Element

### An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag.

The html **element** is everything from the start tag to end tag

<h1>My First Heading</h1>  // this total is Element
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

# Attribute

Syntax

```html
<TagName attribute 1="value" attribute 2="value">Content </TagName>
```

### Additional information about element ex width, height, colors

- All HTML elements can have **attributes**
- Attributes provide **additional information** about elements
- Attributes are always specified in **the  start tag**
- Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: **name="value"**

### *The href Attribute*

The `<a>` tag defines a hyperlink. The `href` attributes specifies  the URL of the page the link goes to: 

```html
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com">Visit W3Schools</a>
```

### *The  src Attribute*

The `<img>` tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page.

The  `<img>`  it is not closing tag  because its attribute is a content. Empty HTML tag

The `src` attribute specifies the path to the image to be displayed:

syntax 

`<img src = "img_girl.jpg">`

   

- There are two ways to specify the URL in the `src` attribute:
    1.  **Absolute URL** - Links to an external image that is hosted on another website. Example: `src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/img_girl.jpg"` .
    
    NOTES : In absolute URL may be occur Copyright issue. OR u can control external images; it can suddenly remove or change.
    
    1. Relative URL -  Links to an image that is hosted within the website. Here, the URL does not include the domain name. If the URL begins without a slash, it will be relative to the current page. 
    Example: `src="img_girl.jpg". If the URL begins with a slash, it will be relative to the domain. Example: src="/images/img_girl.jpg"`.
    
    **Tip :**  It is almost always best to use relative URLs. They will not break if you change domain.
    

### *The Width and Height Attributes*

The `<img>` tag also include width and height  attributes (Pixels):

```html
<img src="img_girl.jbg" width="500"  height="600"> // finish
```

### *The alt Attribute*

The required `alt`  attribute for the `<img>` tag specifies an alternate text for an image, if the image for some reason cannot be displayed. This can be due to slow connection, or an error in the `src`attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader.

Example:

```html
<img src ="img_wrong.jbg"> alt="Girl with a jacket">
```
